-This is a 2D kinematic particle simulator I'm working on in Python.
-It's only in its early stages right now. My current tasks for the project are:
 -Making the plot update automatically so it will look like the particle
 is moving in real time
 -Fixing the axis limits so the plot doesn't stay centered on the particle
 -To run the simulation, as long as you have all the files currently in the repo,
 you should just be able to wrote 'python main.py' to run it
